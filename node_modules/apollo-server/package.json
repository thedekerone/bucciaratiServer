It works with pretty much all Node.js HTTP server frameworks, and we're happy to take PRs to add more! Apollo Server works with any GraphQL schema built with [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)--so you may build your schema with that or a convenience library such as [graphql-tools](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/).\n\n## Principles\n\nApollo Server is built with the following principles in mind:\n\n- **By the community, for the community**: Its development is driven by the needs of developers.\n- **Simplicity**: By keeping things simple, it is more secure and easier to implement and contribute.\n- **Performance**: It is well-tested and production-ready.\n\nAnyone is welcome to contribute to Apollo Server, just read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md), take a look at the [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) and make your first PR!\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started with Apollo Server:\n\n* Install with `npm install apollo-server-<integration>`\n* Write a GraphQL schema\n* Use one of the following snippets\n\nThere are two ways to install Apollo Server:\n\n* **[Standalone](#installation-standalone)**: For applications that do not require an existing web framework, use the `apollo-server` package.\n* **[Integrations](#installation-integrations)**: For applications with a web framework (e.g. `express`, `koa`, `hapi`, etc.), use the appropriate Apollo Server integration package.\n\nFor more info, please refer to the [Apollo Server docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2).\n\n### Installation: Standalone\n\nIn a new project, install the `apollo-server` and `graphql` dependencies using:\n\n    npm install apollo-server graphql\n\nThen, create an `index.js` which defines the schema and its functionality (i.e. resolvers):\n\n```js\nconst { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');\n\n// The GraphQL schema\nconst typeDefs = gql`\n  type Query {\n    \"A simple type for getting started!\"\n    hello: String\n  }\n`;\n\n// A map of functions which return data for the schema.\nconst resolvers = {\n  Query: {\n    hello: () => 'world',\n  },\n};\n\nconst server = new ApolloServer({\n  typeDefs,\n  resolvers,\n});\n\nserver.listen().then(({ url }) => {\n  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);\n});\n```\n\n> Due to its human-readability, we recommend using [schema-definition language (SDL)](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/essentials/schema/#schema-definition-language) to define a GraphQL schema--[a `GraphQLSchema` object from `graphql-js`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/#using-graphqljs) can also be specified instead of `typeDefs` and `resolvers` using the `schema` property:\n>\n> ```js\n> const server = new ApolloServer({\n>   schema: ...\n> });\n> ```\n\nFinally, start the server using `node index.js` and go to the URL returned on the console.\n\nFor more details, check out the Apollo Server [Getting Started guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started.html) and the [fullstack tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction.html).\n\nFor questions, the [Apollo community on Spectrum.chat](https://spectrum.chat) is a great place to get help.\n\n## Installation: Integrations\n\nWhile the standalone installation above can be used without making a decision about which web framework to use, the Apollo Server integration packages are paired with specific web frameworks (e.g. Express, Koa, hapi).\n\nThe following web frameworks have Apollo Server integrations, and each of these linked integrations has its own installation instructions and examples on its package `README.md`:\n\n- [Express](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-express) _(Most popular)_\n- [Koa](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-koa)\n- [Hapi](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-hapi)\n- [Fastify](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-fastify)\n- [Amazon Lambda](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-lambda)\n- [Micro](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-micro)\n- [Azure Functions](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-azure-functions)\n- [Google Cloud Functions](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-cloud-functions)\n- [Cloudflare](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-cloudflare) _(Experimental)_\n\n## Context\n\nA request context is available for each request.  When `context` is defined as a function, it will be called on each request and will receive an object containing a `req` property, which represents the request itself.\n\nBy returning an object from the `context` function, it will be available as the third positional parameter of the resolvers:\n\n```js\nnew ApolloServer({\n  typeDefs,\n  resolvers: {\n    Query: {\n      books: (parent, args, context, info) => {\n        console.log(context.myProperty); // Will be `true`!\n        return books;\n      },\n    }\n  },\n  context: async ({ req }) => {\n    return {\n      myProperty: true\n    };\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe [Apollo Server documentation](https://apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) contains additional details on how to get started with GraphQL and Apollo Server.\n\nThe raw Markdown source of the documentation is available within the `docs/` directory of this monorepo--to contribute, please use the _Edit on GitHub_ buttons at the bottom of each page.\n\n## Development\n\nIf you wish to develop or contribute to Apollo Server, we suggest the following:\n\n- Fork this repository\n\n- Install the Apollo Server project on your computer\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/[your-user]/apollo-server\ncd apollo-server\nnpm install\ncd packages/apollo-server-<integration>/\nnpm link\n```\n\n- Install your local Apollo Server in the other App\n\n```\ncd ~/myApp\nnpm link apollo-server-<integration>\n```\n\n## Community\n\nAre you stuck?
